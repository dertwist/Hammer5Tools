# TODO Full rewrite the editor: future editor should be based on referencing method with replace of certain elements. User can just select
fbx, vsmart, whatever then just type which lines should be replaced, then processed it. Also there should be a button that enabling config monitoring.
When there is any change the program will automatically create all files with replacements.
Also there needing to create last files. The process options should be not as dialog window, but as a part fo the main window editor
The format should be k3 (json). the configuration file have format kv3, but in this file should be a key that notice which for which
 editor this were created.
 The structure of the future editor should be like that:
======= main - consists connections, widgets, lines with
======= common - consists functions, variables
