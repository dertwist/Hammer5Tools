# TODO Complete rewrite of the editor:
The future editor should utilize a referencing method to replace specific elements. Users should be able to select options such as vmdl, vmat, vsmart, etc., and specify which lines need to be replaced.
Once specified, the program should process these changes.
Additionally, there should be a button to enable configuration monitoring. When any changes occur, the program should automatically generate all files with the necessary replacements.

There is also a need to create backup files. The process options should be integrated into the main window of the editor, rather than appearing as a dialog window. The format should be k3 (JSON).
The configuration file should be in kv3 format, but it must include a key indicating which editor it was created for.

The structure of the future editor should be as follows:
- **main**: Contains connections, widgets, and lines.
- **common**: Contains functions and variables.
